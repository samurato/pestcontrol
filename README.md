Smart pest contol
Uses arduino tone library to generate various ultrasonic sounds.
Bluetooth module and speaker is required
An android app to send state 1,2,3,4 is required in order to cycle through different modes
Still in Developement, will be updated as this might not be generating ultrasound. 
However generating various sounds with the changes in data sent by app is achieved.
